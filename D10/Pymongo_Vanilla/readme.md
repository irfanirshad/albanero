# Upsert in MongoDB

Used for update, Upsert is a combination of Insert and Update.

If value of this option is set to 'True', and a document(s) is found that matches the specified query, then the update operation will update the doc(s).


If no doc(s) matches the specified doc, then this option will insert a new doc in the collection .

By default, the upset option value is false.
